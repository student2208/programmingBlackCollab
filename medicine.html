        <h1>Uses of Computer Science in Medicine</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>Computer science has been used to advance many areas of modern medicine. For example:</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Medical Imaging</li>
            <li>Computer Assisted Decision Making</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p2>When dealing with data in medicine there tends to be large amounts, especially in medical research. This data needs to be processed and interpreted to analyse trends.</p2>
        <p3>There are many different processes that need to be applied to this data. For example:</p3>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the mean, median and mode</li>
            <li>Finding the standard deviation</li>
            <li>Various tests of statistical significance</li>
        </ul>
        <p4>These processes, especially the statistical significance tests can be really time consuming. However, using a statistical package greatly reduces the time taken to perform these calculations.</p4>
        <p5>Statistical packages are made of four main components:</p5>
        <dl>
            <dt>Biomedical Computer Package (BMD)<dt>
                <dd>Provides a general set of advanced statistical operations</dd>
            <dt>Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)<dt>
                <dd>Includes more statistical operations including multivariant analysis</dd>
            <dt>Genstat<dt>
                <dd>Specialises on variance analysis</dd>
            <dt>Epi-info<dt>
                <dd>Contains word processing and graphical functions</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Medical Imaging</h3>
        <p2>Computer science, can be used to generate 3D models of human anatomy, among other things. Specific hardware and software can be used to generate these images as well has high resolution CT scans and MRI's</p2>
        <h2>Computer Assisted Decision Making</h2>
        <p2>CMD is a interactive computer system that aids doctors and medical staff to diagnose patients and recommending treatment. It means doctors don't need to know everything in all medical fields, supporting their decision making.</p2>
