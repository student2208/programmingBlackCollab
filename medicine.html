        <h1>Uses of Computer Science in Medicine</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>Computer science has been used to advance many areas of modern medicine. For example:</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Medical Imagining</li>
            <li>Computer Assisted Decision Making</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p2>When dealing with data in medicine there tends to be large amounts, especially in medical research. This data needs to be processed and interpreted to analyse trends.</p2>
        <p3>There are many different processes that need to be applied to this data. For example:</p3>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the mean, median and mode</li>
            <li>Finding the standard deviation</li>
            <li>Various tests of statistical significance</li>
        </ul>
        <p4>These processes, especially the statistical significance tests can be really time consuming. However, using a statistical package greatly reduces the time taken to perform these calculations.</p4>
        <p5>Statistical packages are made of four main components:</p5>
        <dl>
            <dt>Biomedical Computer Package (BMD)<dt>
                <dd>Provides a general set of advanced statistical operations</dd>
            <dt>Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)<dt>
                <dd>Includes more statistical operations including multivariant analysis</dd>
            <dt>Genstat<dt>
                <dd>Specialises on variance analysis</dd>
            <dt>Epi-info<dt>
                <dd>Contains word processing and graphical functions</dd>
