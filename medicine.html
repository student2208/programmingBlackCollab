        <h1>Uses of Computer Science in Medicine</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p1>Computer science has been used to advance many areas of modern medicine. For example:</p1>
        <ul>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Medical Imagining</li>
            <li>Computer Assisted Decision Making</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p2>When dealing with data in medicine there tends to be large amounts, especially in medical research. This data needs to be processed and interpreted to analyse trends</p2>
        <p3>There are many different processes that need to be applied to this data. For example:</p3>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding the mean, median and mode</li>
            <li>Finding the standard deviation</li>
            <li>Various tests of statistical significance</li>
        </ul>
