        <h1>Cyber security:</h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <ul type = "disc">
            <li>Computer science is making constant incredible breakthroughs in the world of cyber security</li>
            <li>This benefits society greatly as it lowers risks involved in using digital services, and contributes to the economy by existing as a constantly growing industry</li>
            <li>In this page, we will discuss 4 main benefits of modern advancements in cyber security:</li>
            <ul type = "circle">
                <li>Protection of data</li>
                <li>Economic contribution</li>
                <li>Risk mitigation</li>
                <li>Building trust</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Protection of data:</h2>
        <ul type = "disc">
            <li>Improvement to cyber security allows businesses that hold sensitive data, such as banks or other financial services, to better safeguard user data.</li>
            <li>This helps to prevent fraud, and therefore reduce risks for the clients of these services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Economic Contribution:</h2>
        <ul type = "disc">
            <li>As cyber security exists as a constantly growing industry, it leads to more and more demand for professionals.</li>
            <li>This leads to job creation and contributing to the global economy through software development, consulting and hardware production.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk mitigation:</h2>
        <ul type = "disc">
            <li>As well as dealing with problems that have already arisen, cyber security can identify problems before they happen.</li>
            <li>By identifying problems before they happen, we can conserve resources and money that would have had to go into solving the problem</li>
            <li>Often the easiest time to fix a problem is before it happens, making identifying problems early very important</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building trust:</h2>
        <ul type = "disc">
            <li>A good history of safeguarding user data is crucial to building a trusting relationship between businesses and customers</li>
            <li>This is crucial, as having the public have a distrust and paranoia around businesses storing their data can lead to them refusing to use these services</li>
            <li>As a society, we need the public to be willing to trust and use services to keep peoples day-to-day lives running smoothly</li>
        </ul>
