    <h1>Climate change mitigation</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Computer science is integral in humanity's fight to combat the effects of climate change</p>
    <h2>Examples:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Modelling and Simulations:</dt>
        <dd>Scientists can use computers to construct models to predict rising temperatures and other climate events</dd>
        <dt>Logistics:</dt>
        <dd>Computers can decide how to use resources efficiently and expand renewable energy infrastructure such as designing power grids</dd>
        <dt>Monitoring:</dt>
        <dd>Sensing technologies can be used for real time monitoring of environmental variables such as water quality and air pollution</dd>
        <dt>Optimising Systems:</dt>
        <dd>Computers can use algorithms in order to maximise efficiency and minimise waste across various critical systems.</dd>
